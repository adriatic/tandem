#### After getting the first feedback from Redwood community members on May 18, 2022, it become apparent that the Tandem project is understood as a Testing and Debugging tutorial. Such conclusion was made because I wasa focusing on the use of the debugger in many different scenarios that were not introduced at this point in thime.

To correct that perception, we are stating the right one: we are building a Redwood Cookbook where debugger is not the only tool in the developers tool box, and tracing Redwood Blog sections are not the only tutorials.
