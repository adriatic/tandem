# Introduction

_**Important note**: as explained in [this discussson](https://github.com/adriatic/tandem/issues/1#issuecomment-1101260396) with this docs site will likely drop the [Tools](https://rw-community.org/tools/introduction) section - it will only exist the creation stage of this site. Similarly the [testing](https://rw-community.org/testing/introduction) and [debugging](https://rw-community.org/debugging/introduction) sections will be likely be shrunk to a few pagraphs, to establish links with similarly named sections in [Redwood docs](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction)._

Expanding on RedwoodJS world class documentation, this collection of pages bundled under the title `Testing and Debugging` offers detailed views on [how to](https://rw-community.org/cookbook/introduction) use several standard [tools](https://rw-community.org/tools/introduction) that are used by JavaScript developers. Two sections`testing` and `debugging` expand the RedwoodJS' [main online document set](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction). 

Since RedwoodJS needs to maintain the _current_ excellence in technical documentation, it is rather obvious that by _providing a formal infrastructure to its developers community_ to participate in the area of writing technical documents, will help reducing the load on Redwood core team.

Creation of the [Testing and Debugging](https://rw-community.org/) online document is a novel concept - unlike the "main" documentation written mostly by RedwoodJS founders and core team members, it is a project that expects the participation of RedwoodJS contributors: (see [this article](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/proposal-testing-and-debugging-project/2923`) for details.

There is another novel approach - we are using the [RedwoodJS tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/tutorial/foreword) as the context to explain the various testing and debugging tools. In other words the same application that is being built from scratch following the instructions from the Redwood tutorial, is being used (in its source form) as content for running tests and debugging in this tutorial.

Lastly, the material presented on this site assumes the familiarity with these introductory information from the original RedwoodJS online docs section on [Project Configuration: Dev, Test, Build](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/project-configuration-dev-test-build):

- [jest](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/project-configuration-dev-test-build#jest)
- [debugger configuration](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/project-configuration-dev-test-build#debugger-configuration)
