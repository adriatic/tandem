# introduction

This is likely the longest of all docs section as all of the "real life" examples will be hosted here. It is envisioned as a potpourri of how to use all of the [tools](https://rw-community.org/tools/introduction) in all cases listed in [testing](https://rw-community.org/testing/introduction) and [debugging](https://rw-community.org/debugging/introduction).
