# Trace

### Tracing the authentication code

To summarize our state at this point in time

1. We cloned and built the `Redwood Blog` application in a local folder `redwood-blog`
2. The application is running in the browser as http://localhost:8910/
3. A different browser instance runs the Tandem tutorial as https://rw-community.org/how-to/debug/chrome/trace

This description matches the situation depicted in Image 3 in the [previous section](https://rw-community.org/how-to/debug/chrome/setup):
