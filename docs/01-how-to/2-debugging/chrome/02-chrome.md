## Example 1 - tracing the authentication code

### The workflow

Follow the instructions in the [example-1](https://rw-community.org/how-to/debugging/chrome/example-1). Also have the [authentication](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/tutorial/chapter4/authentication) chapter in the [Redwood Tutorial](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/tutorial/foreword) ready, so you can trace through the code, using the explanations from both tandem and Redwood tutorials.

---

Let's start with a simple practice - step through the authentication code of the Redwood Tutorial Blog application which you can fetch [here](https://github.com/adriatic/tandem-tutorial-samples) - main branch. This application is a clone of the original [redwood-tutorial-blog](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood-tutorial), and the "main branch" attribute indicates that this application is not "spiked" with any induced problems.

In order to start, create a local clone of the [finished Redwood Blog](https://github.com/adriatic/tandem-tutorial-samples) in the folder `/Users/nik/tandem` (replace `nik` with your user name)


The plan is to step through the code of the [Authentication chapter] (https://redwoodjs.com/docs/tutorial/chapter4/authentication)
