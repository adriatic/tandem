# tandem

This website with the title `Redwood Testing and Debugging`, presents detailed information about several [standard tools](https://rw-community.org/tools/introduction) most often used in Redwood application development process. This project is the first in the series written by RedwoodJS contributors, enabling faster improvement of the core product by leaving the core team in charge of "only" the core product (the word only in quotation marks is an attempt to jokingly state how the core team is already making miracles.)

The two main section of this online documentation site are

- [debug](https://rw-community.org/how-to/debug/introduction)

- [test](https://rw-community.org/how-to/test/introduction)

contain information on both subjects (testing and debugging) in the context of Redwood applications development

These two sections extend the RedwoodJS' [main online documents](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction).
