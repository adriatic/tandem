This website has the title Redwood Testing and Debugging. It presents detailed information of using several [standard tools](https://rw-community.org/tools/introduction) often used in Redwood application development process. The two sections [testing](https://rw-community.org/testing/introduction), [debugging]() extend the RedwoodJS' [main online document](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction). It is the [how to](https://rw-community.org/how-to/introduction) that contains a lot of information on both subjects (testing and debugging) in the title of this site.


This project is the first in series written by RedwoodJS contributors, enabling faster improvement of the core product by leaving to core team in charge of "only" core product.
