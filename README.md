This website with the title `Redwood Testing and Debugging`, presents detailed information about using several [standard tools](https://rw-community.org/tools/introduction) most often used in Redwood application development process. This project is the first in the series written by RedwoodJS contributors, enabling faster improvement of the core product by leaving the core team in charge of "only" the core product.

The two main section of this online documentation site are

- [how  to debug](https://rw-community.org/how-to/debugging/introduction)

- [how to test]()
(https://rw-community.org/how-to/introduction) that contains a lot of information on both subjects (testing and debugging) in the title of this site.

- The two sections [testing](https://rw-community.org/testing/introduction), [debugging](https://rw-community.org/how-to/debug/introduction) extend the RedwoodJS' [main online document](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction).
